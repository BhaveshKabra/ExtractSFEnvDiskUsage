# ExtractSFEnvDiskUsage
Its useful to know how much Disk utilization is needed no matter what application u use. 
Salesforce Disk utilization is an important aspect since its a cloud app. 
Its also important to extract dev/Qa regions data as well. 
I have prepared an automated tool via which u could easily extract the same. 
Code uses Java and Selenium on code front and uses an property file for username and passwords
You may also enhance the code by using the encryption for username and password.
If your starting url is different u may also customize it. You can also segrigate the code to get all dev/qa regions disk utilization by using region details as seen in code.
Output code is stored in html in a tablular format which would be easy to use
